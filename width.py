# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17
height = 12.0
exp1 = width//2
exp2 = width/2.0
exp3 = height/3
exp4 = 1 + 2 * 5
print("The value of expression 1 is:",exp1, "and its value type is:",type(exp1))
print("The value of expression 2 is:",exp2, "and its value type is:",type(exp2))
print("The value of expression 3 is:",exp3, "and its value type is:", type(exp3))
print("The value of expression 4 is:",exp4, "and its value type is:",type(exp4))
